CARING FOR MICROFIBER SHOES:
Caring for microfiber is pretty easy if you know the rules. Towels, dusters and mops made of microfiber can last hundreds of washings if you stay away from the 2 big no-nos for microfiber:

No Heat in the dryer!
No Fabric Softeners!

THE Oxy micro fiber drving shoes  

Driving shoes are basically the sporty, European cousin of the loafer. The leather driving shoe is a simple slip-on shoe with rubber-grommet soles. Like the loafer, the driving shoe is a descendant of the moccasin but was invented for... yep; driving.

In the early 1960’s, an Italian shoe company rolled out the driving shoe in response to men’s complaints that their traditional shoes felt too cumbersome for driving their swanky Italian roadsters. Originally a luxury reserved only for the very wealthy, over time, the leather driving shoe has expanded its user profile.

A great choice for any moderately dressed up occasion, leather driving shoes pair well with shorts or slim pants, but like loafers: no socks. Drivers are ideal for driving (obviously), flying (easy on-and-off through security), business-casual at the office, and lunch or dinner out; but, leave them at home if you’re planning a long walk around the city. The soles of driving shoes are designed for grip and sensitivity, not for strenuous use.  

Can’t decide? Take a minute to check out our collection of leather driving shoes and loafers.
